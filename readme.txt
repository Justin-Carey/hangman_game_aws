This repository contains a web-app, simulating a game of hangman. The web-app comes with user registration ability and high-score keeping.

It utilizes several AWS services, such as: Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, API Dashboard, and Lambda.

To participate, navigate to the index page here:

http://hangman-justin-carey.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html

You'll register with an email and password, then be asked to verify. The verification code will be sent to your email (given it's valid).

Once verified, you'll sign in again, and be taken to the main hangman page where you can play.
